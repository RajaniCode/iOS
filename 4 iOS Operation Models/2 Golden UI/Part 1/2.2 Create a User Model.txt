2.2 Create a User Model


InstaPhoto has a User Model Class that is similar to the functionality that the City Model Class provides in Planet HIG.

Create a User Model Class @interface that contains (strong, nonatomic) NSString @property variables for each of the keys in the userProfile.json tab.


userProfile.json
{
    "firstName": "Mr.",
    "lastName": "Higgie",
    "city": "Cupertino",
    "profilePhoto": "http://operation-models.codeschool.com/higgie_profile_image.png",
    "profilePhotoThumbnail": "http://operation-models.codeschool.com/higgie_profile_image_thumbnail.png",
    "biography": "Mr. Higgie was designed in California but loves to travel to exotic places. Earning a PhD in Material Science when he was only 3 years old, Mr. Higgie hasn't yet gone on to do great things. He lives at home with his parents.",
    "memberSince": "November 2012"
}


User.m
#import "User.h"

@implementation User

-(id)init
{
    self = [super init];
    return self;
}

@end


User.h
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

(Define the User Model @interface and @property variables)


Answer:
User.h
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface User : NSObject

@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *firstName;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *lastName;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *city;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *profilePhoto;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *profilePhotoThumbnail;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *biography;
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *memberSince;

@end
