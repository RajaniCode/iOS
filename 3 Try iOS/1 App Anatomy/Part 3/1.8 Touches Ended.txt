1.8 Touches Ended

Apps are meant to be touched. Make it so the ViewController below responds to touch events. Implement the method touchesEnded:withEvent: and inside that method use NSLog to print a message to the console that a touch event occurred.


ViewController.m
#import "ViewController.h"

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
  [super viewDidLoad];
}
@end


Answer:
