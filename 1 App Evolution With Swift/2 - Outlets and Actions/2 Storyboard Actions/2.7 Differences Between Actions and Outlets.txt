2.7 Differences Between Actions and Outlets

How are actions different from outlets?

[Single Answer]

Outlets are used to get data out of a controller, and actions are used to get data into it.
Actions can't be used to directly change the attributes of objects in the storyboard.
Actions can only be attached to buttons while outlets can be created between any views.
