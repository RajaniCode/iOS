1.3 Displaying a Map

We'll start by creating a Camera, which will be used to set our initial map.

For this camera, we want it to show up at latitude 37.790706, longitude -122.434167 and at zoom 13. We don't want the map to be rotated or skewed in any way.


- (void)viewDidLoad {
  [super viewDidLoad];

  GMSCameraPosition *camera = [GMSCameraPosition
    cameraWithLatitude: [ ]
             longitude: [ ]
                  zoom: [ ]
               bearing: [ ]
          viewingAngle: [ ]
  ];

  self.mapView = [
    GMSMapView mapWithFrame:self.view.frame camera:camera
  ];
  [self.view addSubview:self.mapView];
}
