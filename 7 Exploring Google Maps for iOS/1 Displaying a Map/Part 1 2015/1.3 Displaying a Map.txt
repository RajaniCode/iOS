1.3 Displaying a Map


For the rest of the course we’re going to build an app that shows the locations of some food trucks in San Francisco, CA.

In this challenge, we’re going to configure and display a map. This map will be the basis for the rest of the challenges in this course.

Tasks for Level1-3-DisplayingAMap

    Start by creating a GMSCameraPosition object with the following properties:
    - latitude: 37.790706
    - longitude: -122.434167
    - zoom: 13
    - bearing: 0
    - viewingAngle: 0


Using the GMSCameraPosition object you created in the previous step, create a GMSMapView and add it to TruckMapVC.


Set the map view’s type to terrain.


Turn on the my location icon and compass button, and disable zoom gestures.


Adjust the map padding so the compass button isn’t hidden underneath the navigation bar. Use the self.topLayoutGuide.length as the padding value.
