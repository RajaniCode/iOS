3.2 NSSet vs. NSArray

Why is it a good practice to use an NSSet rather than an NSArray for storing markers?

[Single Answer]

NSArray is mutable and won't allow us to add more objects to it.
Objects can be added to NSSet at any time, unlike NSArray.
By using an NSSet with objects that have an isEqual method, you can verify marker uniqueness.
Using an NSSet will automatically verify uniqueness of objects, preventing duplicates from being added.
