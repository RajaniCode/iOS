1.5 Status Bar Layout


In this challenge, we’re going to start looking at one of the most immediately obvious differences between iOS 6 and iOS 7 - the changes to the status bar and how it affects layout.

Tasks

1. In CSAboutVC.h, Declare a UIView property named contentSubview that we’ll use to hold all of the subviews in the rest of the challenges in this section.


2. In the CSAboutVC loadView method, create a new UIView and assign it to the contentSubview property you just created. Then, add all the other subviews to the contentSubview instead of the controller’s root view.

Once you’ve done that, don’t forget to add contentSubview as a subview of the controller’s root view too.


3. Set the frame of self.contentSubview in the viewWillLayoutSubviews method.

The x position should be 0 and the width should be the same as the width of self.view.frame, but the y position and height should take the value of the self.topLayoutGuide.length property into consideration.
