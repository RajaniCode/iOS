8. Creating a number object


Strings are fantastic, but we are just scratching the surface of the types of objects we can create.

Scratching the surface? Sounds like my worst nightmare

We’re going to spend the rest of this level talking about some other types of objects available in Objective-C, starting with numbers.

Note: Wondering where the word "objects" is coming from? Remember that "variable" just refers to the box. The "object" is the thing stored inside the box. So firstName is a variable, while @"Apple" is an object. Sometimes we'll just use "object" as a shorthand when referring to a variable holding an object.

Creating a number is very similar to creating strings:

NSNumber *ipodBirthdayYear = @2001;
NSNumber *iphoneBirthdayYear = @2007;
NSNumber *ipadBirthdayYear = @2010;

As you can see, instead of NSString we are using NSNumber. We also leave off the quotes and just have a @ followed by a number.

Go ahead and create a NSNumber to hold your age (don't worry, all ages are welcome to learn Objective-C)


NSNumber *age = @39;
