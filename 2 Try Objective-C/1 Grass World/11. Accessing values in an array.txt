11. Accessing values in an array


You can access values in a NSArray by referencing a number inside of brackets after the array variable name.

apps[0] results in the first object in the array, apps[1] results in the second object, and so on.

Try printing the second NSString in the array like this:

NSLog(@"%@", apps[1]);


Answer: NSLog(@"%@", apps[1]);
