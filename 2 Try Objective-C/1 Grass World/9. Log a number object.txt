9. Log a number object


You can’t log an NSNumber object by passing it directly to NSLog like we did earlier with the firstName object. But you can use the %@ placeholder object in a formatted string to log a representation of the number.

So if you just wanted to log out the age object, you would have to do this:

NSLog(@"%@", age);

Complete the code to the right to log both the firstName and age objects


Answer: NSLog(@"%@ is %@ years old", firstName, age);
