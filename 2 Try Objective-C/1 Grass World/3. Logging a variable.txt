3. Logging a variable


Now we have a variable that is storing a string with your first name. But how do we get the string back out of the box? This is so common that it’s as simple as possible: just refer to the name of the variable. So in place of using @"Apple" you can use the variable name firstName.

Log your first name again but this time use the firstName variable


Answer: NSLog(firstName);
