2. Creating a variable


Congratulations Apple, you’ve created your first string and logged it to the Output window.

It would get very old having to type out @"Apple" every time you wanted a string with your name in it, but there’s a way to store our name so we can easily access it later.

We can store strings (and other values) in something called a variable. Variables are like boxes with a label. We put something in a box (a string) and give it a name so we can find it later. The name of a variable is usually descriptive of what is inside, and it usually starts with a lowercase letter and contains no spaces.

Just like you have to choose an appropriate type of box to store something in, you have to choose the appropriate type of variable to store a value in. For string values, the type of variable you have to choose is NSString *. Here is how you’d create a string variable:

NSString *firstName = @"Apple";

NSString * is the type of variable (we’ll cover why we need that * later in the course), and the = operator stores the string @"Apple" in a variable with the name firstName.

Go ahead and fill out the code to the right to create your first string variable


Answer: NSString *firstName = @"Apple";
