1. Creating output


Today you’re going to learn a little bit about Objective-C. To help us out along the way, we’ve invited Mr. Higgie. He’s an Objective-C expert and a friend of ours since 2007. Say hello, Mr. Higgie.

NSLog(@"Hello, Mr. Higgie.");

Please don’t laugh, it will only make him think he’s funny. But thank you Mr. Higgie for introducing us to NSLog, a function that adds stuff to the Output window.

The bit between the parentheses is the way we represent a string of characters in Objective-C. You can put whatever you want in a string, like the opening line from Mr. Higgie’s favorite book:

@"Call me Ishmael."

To invoke the NSLog function, just follow Mr. Higgie’s helpful example above.

Use NSLog to output a string containing your first name


Answer: NSLog("@Apple");
