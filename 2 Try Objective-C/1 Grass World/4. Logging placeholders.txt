4. Logging placeholders


NSLog is a powerful function. Sure, you can just pass it a single string and it will output it for you. But you can also pass it a string that contains placeholders, and NSLog will dutifully replace each placeholder with the extra values you give it.

Try submitting NSLog(@"Hello there, %@.", firstName); to see what the output looks like.


Answer: NSLog(@"Hello there, %@.", firstName);
