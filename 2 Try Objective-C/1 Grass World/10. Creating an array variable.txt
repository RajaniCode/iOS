10. Creating an array variable


Creating one object at a time is great, but we don’t really have to store every single object in its own variable, like this:

NSString *angryFowl = @"AngryFowl";
NSString *lettertouch = @"Lettertouch";
NSString *tweetrobot = @"Tweetrobot";

It looks like you're trying to make a list, would you like me to create an array for you?

Arrays are very useful for when we don’t want to have a bunch of variables that each hold a single value, but when we want a single variable to hold multiple values. Create an array to hold our list of apps by submitting this code:

NSArray *apps = @[@"AngryFowl", @"Lettertouch", @"Tweetrobot"];


Answer: NSArray *apps = @[@"AngryFowl", @"Lettertouch", @"Tweetrobot"];
