5. NSLog() placeholders


The string you’re logging is called a formatted string. See how %@ is replaced with the value from firstName so that the full message appears in the output window?

In NSLog(), %@ is just a placeholder that means “I’m going to be replaced by a variable that is also passed into NSLog”. You can include as many placeholders as you need and they will be replaced in the order they are defined.

There is no reason to limit yourself to one placeholder. Try logging firstName twice with a space in between.


Answer: NSLog(@"%@ %@", firstName, firstName);
