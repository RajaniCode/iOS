14. Accessing values in a dictionary


Accessing the values in a dictionary works exactly like it does with an array, except instead of using a number, you use the key. So if you wanted to log the rating of the @"AngryFowl" app, you could do this:

NSLog(@"%@", appRatings[@"AngryFowl"]);

Go ahead and log the rating of the @"Lettertouch" app


Answer: NSLog(@"Lettertouch has a rating of %@.", appRatings[@"Lettertouch"]);
