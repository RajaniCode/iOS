2. Naming your class


The first decision you have to make when creating a class is what to name it.

Object and class names are usually nouns, like Car or NSDictionary or Boat.

It’s also a good idea to use conventions when naming things, especially in Objective-C. There is already a very strong convention to start classes with a capital letter. This makes it easy to tell the difference between a class (starts with uppercase letter) and an object (starts with lowercase letter). Nothing in the language enforces this, but it’s considered a good practice to follow the conventions of a language.

Remember, we are trying to create a class to replace this NSDictionary:

NSDictionary *talkingiPhone = @{
  @"Name": @"Mr. Higgie",
  @"ModelNumber": @1
};

So go ahead and decide on a name and enter it in the editor to the right. We'll be using this name to build out a class for the rest of this level.

Personally I'd go with MrHiggieIsAnAmazingPhoneAndIsLovedByEveryone
