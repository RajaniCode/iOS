13. Method that returns a result


What if instead of having speak just log the phoneName value we could have it create and return a string as a result? Then, whoever sends the speak message can store that NSString return value in a variable.

We already know that messages can have results, but how do you define a method that returns a result? The first thing we have to do is declare what type of object the method will return in its header file. For example, let’s say we want to define a fullName method on the Person class that returns an NSString:

Person.h

@interface Person : NSObject
@property NSString *firstName;
@property NSString *lastName;

- (NSString *)fullName;

Here the fullName method has a return type defined in the parentheses as NSString *. Now all we have to do is update the method implementation and use the keyword return to tell the method to return a string:

Person.m

#import "Person.h"

@implementation Person

- (NSString *)fullName;
{
   return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", self.firstName, self.lastName];
}
@end

You can return any type of object you want. For example, maybe you want a person’s first name and last name as an array instead of a string:

Person.m

#import "Person.h"

@implementation Person

- (NSArray *)names;
{
   return @[self.firstName, self.lastName];
}
@end

Update the speak method to create and return a string instead of logging it. Remember, you have to set the return type in both the header and implementation files.


Apple.h
@interface Apple : NSObject

@property NSString *phoneName;
@property NSString *modelNumber;

- (void) speak;
@end


Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple
-(void)speak;
{
    NSString *message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ says Hello There!", self.phoneName];
    return /*//return the message variable//*/;
}
@end


Answer:
Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple
-(NSString *)speak;
{
    NSString *message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ says Hello There!", self.phoneName];
    return message;
}
@end


Apple.h
@interface Apple : NSObject

@property NSString *phoneName;
@property NSString *modelNumber;

- (NSString *) speak;
@end
