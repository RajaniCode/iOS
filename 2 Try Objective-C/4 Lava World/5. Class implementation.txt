5. Class implementation


Now that we have a class interface for Apple, it’s time we do some implementing. Remember that if the class interface is like a restaurant menu, the class implementation is like the kitchen: it’s where properties and methods get made.

For example, let’s say we’ve defined a class interface for a Person class with two properties:

@interface Person : NSObject
@property NSString *firstName;
@property NSString *lastName;
@end

Now all we have to do to implement the Person class is this:

@implementation Person
@end

What happened to the firstName and lastName properties?

Properties are special because they are automatically implemented once the class is implemented. This isn’t the case with methods, but we’ll get to that in a bit.
File Organization

Before we implement the Apple class, there is one more thing we have to cover: file organization and importing. When you’re creating a class, you don’t want to put the header and the implementation in the same file. That would be like keeping the menus in the kitchen - how would customers ever know what to order?

The same goes for classes. The convention in Objective-C is to name the header file ClassName.h and the implementation file ClassName.m. So the Person class above would be defined in two files:

Person.h

@interface Person : NSObject
@property NSString *firstName;
@property NSString *lastName;
@end

Person.m

#import "Person.h"

@implementation Person
@end

Because we’ve separated the implementation of Person from the interface, we have to import the interface file in Person.m. That #import command will find the Person.h file and “copy” it into the Person.m file.

Now go ahead and implement the Apple class in the Apple.m file to the right. As you can see we've already imported the header file for you.


Apple.h
@interface Apple : NSObject

@property NSString *phoneName;
@property NSString *modelNumber;

@end


Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

/*//Add the class implementation//*/


Answer:
Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple
@end
