12. Logging a property instead of self


In case you missed it, this is the result of logging the self variable in speak:

  Apple.m[6]: <Apple: 0x7fbbfb40ad70> says Hello There!

A confusing memory address isn’t exactly the most helpful log message.

Change the speak implementation to log the phoneName property instead of just self. Be sure to access the phoneName property on self.


Example Use
#import "Apple.h"

Apple *talkingiPhone = [[Apple alloc] init];
talkingiPhone.phoneName = @"Mr. Higgie";

[talkingiPhone speak];


Apple.h
@interface Apple : NSObject

@property NSString *phoneName;
@property NSString *modelNumber;

- (void) speak;

@end


Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple
-(void)speak;
{
    NSLog(@"%@ says Hello There!", self);
}
@end


Answer:
Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple
-(void)speak;
{
    NSLog(@"%@ says Hello There!", self.phoneName);
}
@end


Output:
Apple.m[6]: Mr. Higgie says Hello There!
