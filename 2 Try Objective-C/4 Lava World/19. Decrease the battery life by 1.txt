19. Decrease the battery life by 1


Now that our Apple class has a property for batteryLife, we can have methods that not only can read the batteryLife value, but also change it.

Add a new method to Apple called decreaseBatteryLife. It doesn't need to take any arguments or return anything. All it should do is decrease the batteryLife property by 1.

You'll see that we've provided the method definition block in the implementation file.

Note: If you are curious, this piece of code: @([self.batteryLife intValue] - 1); results in a NSNumber * object that is 1 less than self.batteryLife. It does this using an Objective-C boxed expression literal.


Example Use
#import "Apple.h"

Apple *talkingiPhone = [[Apple alloc] init];
talkingiPhone.phoneName = @"Mr. Higgie";
talkingiPhone.batteryLife = @100;

[talkingiPhone decreaseBatteryLife];
[talkingiPhone reportBatteryLife];


Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple

/*//Copy the decreaseBatteryLife declaration from the header//*/
{
  self.batteryLife = @([self.batteryLife intValue] - 1);
}

- (void) reportBatteryLife;
{
    NSLog(@"Battery life is %@", self.batteryLife);
}

- (NSString *)speak:(NSString *)greeting;
{
    NSString *message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ says %@", self.phoneName, greeting];
    return message;
}
@end


Apple.h
@interface Apple : NSObject

@property NSString *phoneName;
@property NSString *modelNumber;
@property NSNumber *batteryLife;

/*//Declare the decreaseBatteryLife method here//*/

- (void) reportBatteryLife;
- (NSString *) speak:(NSString *)greeting;

@end


Answer:
Apple.h
@interface Apple : NSObject

@property NSString *phoneName;
@property NSString *modelNumber;
@property NSNumber *batteryLife;

-(void) decreaseBatteryLife;
- (void) reportBatteryLife;
- (NSString *) speak:(NSString *)greeting;

@end


Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple

-(void) decreaseBatteryLife;
{
  self.batteryLife = @([self.batteryLife intValue] - 1);
}

- (void) reportBatteryLife;
{
    NSLog(@"Battery life is %@", self.batteryLife);
}

- (NSString *)speak:(NSString *)greeting;
{
    NSString *message = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ says %@", self.phoneName, greeting];
    return message;
}
@end


Output:
Apple.m[12]: Battery life is 99
