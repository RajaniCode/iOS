7. Practice creating a class


That was a lot to cover, so let’s practice a little bit by completing the following steps:

1. Create an instance of Apple class named talkingDroid.

2. Set its phoneName and modelNumber properties.

3. Log out both properties using NSLog.


Apple.m
#import "Apple.h"

@implementation Apple
@end


Apple.h
@interface Apple : NSObject

@property NSString *phoneName;
@property NSString *modelNumber;

@end


Challenge
#import "Apple.h"                                          

/*//Create a Apple object and call it talkingDroid//*/
/*//Set its phoneName and modelNumber properties//*/

NSLog(@"phoneName: %@", talkingDroid.phoneName);
NSLog(@"modelNumber: %@", talkingDroid.modelNumber);


Answer:
Challenge
#import "Apple.h"                                          

Apple *talkingDroid = [[Apple alloc] init];
talkingDroid.phoneName = @"iPhone";
[talkingDroid setModelNumber:@"7"];

NSLog(@"phoneName: %@", talkingDroid.phoneName);
NSLog(@"modelNumber: %@", talkingDroid.modelNumber);


Output:
challenge[7]: phoneName: iPhone

challenge[8]: modelNumber: 7
