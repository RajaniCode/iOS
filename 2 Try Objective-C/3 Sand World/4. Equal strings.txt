4. Equal strings


We should probably stop picking on Mr. Higgie so much. He’s not all bad. In fact, there is a lighter side to Mr. Higgie: he loves wearing hats.

It's true. I tan too easily.

In fact, if you want to find out which hat Mr. Higgie is wearing, send the mrHiggie object the currentHat message and it will return the type of hat in the form of a NSString.

We can also pass an NSString the isEqualToString: message, which will compare two NSString objects. If they have exactly the same characters then the message will return YES, and otherwise it will return NO. We can use isEqualToString: inside if statements to conditionally execute code based on the characters in a string, like so:

if([myString isEqualToString:otherString]) {
  NSLog(@"Hello from inside the if!");
}

As you can see in the editor to the right, we’re already logging out different messages depending on the result of [mrHiggie currentHat]. We recently learned that Mr. Higgie has purchased a new hat with the name @"AstronautHelmet".

Add another else if to log a different message whenever this @"AstronautHelmet" hat is encountered.

Note: else if's have to be between the if and else


File
NSString *hat = [mrHiggie currentHat];

if([hat isEqualToString:@"Sombrero"]) {
  NSLog(@"Ese es un muy buen sombrero");
} else if ([hat isEqualToString:@"Fedora"]) {
  NSLog(@"Mr. Higgie was an iPhone before there was iPhone");
} else {
  NSLog(@"Mr. Higgie is currently hatless");
}


Answer:
File
NSString *hat = [mrHiggie currentHat];

if([hat isEqualToString:@"Sombrero"]) {
  NSLog(@"Ese es un muy buen sombrero");
} else if ([hat isEqualToString:@"Fedora"]) {
  NSLog(@"Mr. Higgie was an iPhone before there was iPhone");
} else if([hat isEqualToString:@"AstronautHelmet"]) {
  NSLog(@"Mr. Higgies was an Astronaught"); 
} else {
  NSLog(@"Mr. Higgie is currently hatless");
}


Output:
challenge[8]: Mr. Higgies was an Astronaught
