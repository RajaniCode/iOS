8. Enumerating an NSDictionary


Fast Enumeration is not limited to NSArray objects and can be used on NSDictionary objects as well:

NSDictionary *funnyWords = @{
  @"Schadenfreude": @"pleasure derived by someone from another person's misfortune.",
  @"Portmanteau": @"consisting of or combining two or more separable aspects or qualities",
  @"Penultimate": @"second to the last"
};

for (NSString *word in funnyWords){
  NSString *definition = funnyWords[word];
  NSLog(@"%@ is defined as %@", word, definition);
}

When you fast enumerate through an NSDictionary object, the value of the word variable would cycle through the keys in the funnyWords dictionary. Then, inside the fast enumeration block {} you can use the key to look up the associated value, demonstrated above by getting the definition for the current word:

NSString *definition = funnyWords[word];

Go ahead and submit the challenge code to the right to see how fast enumerating through an NSDictionary object works.


File
NSDictionary *funnyWords = @{
  @"Schadenfreude": @"pleasure derived by someone from another person's misfortune.",
  @"Portmanteau": @"consisting of or combining two or more separable aspects or qualities",
  @"Penultimate": @"second to the last"
};

for (NSString *word in funnyWords) {
  NSString *definition = funnyWords[word];
  NSLog(@"%@ is defined as %@", word, definition);
}


Answer:
File
NSDictionary *funnyWords = @{
  @"Schadenfreude": @"pleasure derived by someone from another person's misfortune.",
  @"Portmanteau": @"consisting of or combining two or more separable aspects or qualities",
  @"Penultimate": @"second to the last"
};

for (NSString *word in funnyWords) {
  NSString *definition = funnyWords[word];
  NSLog(@"%@ is defined as %@", word, definition);
}


Output:
challenge[9]: Penultimate is defined as second to the last

challenge[9]: Schadenfreude is defined as pleasure derived by someone from another person's misfortune.

challenge[9]: Portmanteau is defined as consisting of or combining two or more separable aspects or qualities
