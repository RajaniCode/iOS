12. Enumerate with blocks


The vast majority of the time, you won’t be assigning a block to a variable and invoking it yourself. Instead, you’ll be passing a block as an argument to a message, like the enumerateObjectsUsingBlock: message on NSArray.

enumerateObjectsUsingBlock: can be used as a replacement for fast enumeration since it does basically the same thing: executes a block of code for each object in an array. But instead of using special syntax, it uses normal message sending and blocks.

So you could replace this fast enumeration code:

for (NSString *word in funnyWords) {
  NSLog(@"%@ is a funny word", word);
}

With this:

[funnyWords enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:
  ^(NSString *word, NSUInteger index, BOOL *stop){
    NSLog(@"%@ is a funny word", word);  
  }
];

This block will be invoked once for each object in the funnyWords array. Each time it is invoked, it will be passed three arguments: an NSString * which represents an object in the funnyWords array, an NSUInteger which is the index at which the current object is located, and a BOOL * argument which allows you to stop enumerating the array if you want.

Notice how we aren’t assigning this block to a variable, instead we are passing the block directly with the message send as an argument. We could just as easily rewrite the above code to first assign the block to a variable and then pass it in to the message:

void (^enumeratingBlock)(NSString *, NSUInteger, BOOL *) = 
  ^(NSString *word, NSUInteger index, BOOL *stop){
    NSLog(@"%@ is a funny word", word);
  };
                         
[funnyWords enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:enumeratingBlock];

But as you can see it takes a lot less code to just pass it in directly, and is generally considered a best practice.

We're over here talking about practice? Practice?!?.

Don't listen to Mr. Higgie. Practice using blocks by rewriting the fast enumeration code to use enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:


File
NSArray *newHats = @[@"Cowboy", @"Conductor", @"Baseball", @"Beanie", @"Beret", @"Fez"];

for (NSString *hat in newHats) {
   NSLog(@"Trying on hat %@", hat);
}


Answer:
File
NSArray *newHats = @[@"Cowboy", @"Conductor", @"Baseball", 
  @"Beanie", @"Beret", @"Fez"];

/*
for (NSString *hat in newHats) {
   NSLog(@"Trying on hat %@", hat);
}
*/

void (^enumeratingBlock)(NSString *, NSUInteger, BOOL *) = 
  ^(NSString *hat, NSUInteger index, BOOL *stop){
  NSLog(@"Trying on hat %@", hat);  
};

[newHats enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:enumeratingBlock];


Output:
challenge[12]: Trying on hat Cowboy

challenge[12]: Trying on hat Conductor

challenge[12]: Trying on hat Baseball

challenge[12]: Trying on hat Beanie

challenge[12]: Trying on hat Beret
