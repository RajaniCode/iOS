1. A simple if


Have you ever made a decision and then afterwards immediately regretted it?

Well, computers don’t feel regret but that doesn’t mean they can’t make decisions.

I decide to regret nothing

The simplest way to make a decision in Objective-C is to use an if statement:

if (mrHiggieIsMean) {
  NSLog(@"Confirmed: he is super mean");
}

The lines of code inside the curly-braces {} are only executed if the code in the parentheses () after the if is true. But how do we know what is true and what is false?

In Objective-C, there is a special data type meant to handle this exact situation. A variable defined with the BOOL type can be set to either YES (true) or NO (false). You can declare a BOOL variable like this:

BOOL mrHiggieIsMean = NO;

if (mrHiggieIsMean) {
  NSLog(@"Confirmed: he is super mean");
}

Only when the if encounters a YES will it execute the code inside the curly-braces {}.

Go ahead and set the mrHiggieIsMean variable to YES so the code inside the curly-braces is executed.


File
/*//Set mrHiggieIsMean to YES//*/

if (mrHiggieIsMean) {
  NSLog(@"Confirmed: he is super mean");
}


Answer:
File
BOOL mrHiggieIsMean = YES;

if (mrHiggieIsMean) {
  NSLog(@"Confirmed: he is super mean");
}


Output:
