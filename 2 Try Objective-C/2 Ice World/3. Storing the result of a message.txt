3. Storing the result of a message


What if I want to store the result of passing a message in a variable?

Well, Mr. Higgie, we just used the result of the description message in an NSLog(). Instead, what if we wanted to store the result in a variable? First, we need to think about what type of object description returns.

When you send a message to an object that’s built-in to the Objective-C language, the easiest way to find out the return type is to look at the documentation.

If you take a look at the NSArray description documentation, you’ll see something like this:

- (NSString *)description

This means that the return type is an NSString * object.

Note: Most objects in Objective-C have a description method that returns a string that represents the data in the object.

So if you want to save the result of description in a variable, just set the value of an NSString object equal to the value returned by passing the description message, like this:

NSString *result = [myArrayObject description];

Try storing result of sending the description message to the foods array in a variable named result, and then log out the contents of result with an NSLog() function.


File
NSArray *foods = @[@"tacos", @"burgers"];             
NSString *result = /*//send description to foods//*/;

NSLog(@"%@", /*//pass in result here//*/);


Answer:
File
NSArray *foods = @[@"tacos", @"burgers"];             
NSString *result = [foods description];

NSLog(@"%@", result);


Output:
challenge[4]: (

    tacos,

    burgers

)
