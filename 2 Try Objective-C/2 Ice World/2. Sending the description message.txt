2. Sending the description message


Congrats on sending your first message!

The tryobjc object is something we made up, but the objects built-in to Objective-C, like NSString, NSNumber, and NSArray, are real and have a bunch of messages you can send to them.

One of those messages is description, and there’s something extra cool about it - passing the message returns a result. Not all messages return something, but the description message always returns an NSString that represents the contents of the object that you passed the message to.

If you send description to an NSString object, you’ll get the characters in that string, but if you send it to an NSArray you’ll get a string containing all of the values in that array.

Let’s practice sending a message and doing something with the result. Luckily we’ve already got a cool NSArray from Level 1:

NSArray *foods = @[@"tacos", @"burgers"];

Try sending the description message to the foods array inside of NSLog() to see what it returns.


Answer: NSLog(@"%@", [foods description]);


Output: 

challenge[3]: (

    tacos,

    burgers

)
