1. Sending a message


Playing with simple values is nice, but the fun really begins when you start “sending messages”. Sending a message will be the basic building block of your Objective-C apps because it is how you tell an object to perform some action or to give you some piece of information.

To send a message, you need at least two things - an object and a message name:

[objectName messageName];

The object name goes on the left, followed by a space and then the message name, and then the whole thing is wrapped inside square-brackets.

Note: "Sending a message" is sometimes referred to as "calling a method". You'll find Objective-C programmers using both of these phrases to mean basically the same thing.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to message sending.

Let's start exploring by sending a simple message called completeThisChallenge to the tryobjc object, like this: [tryobjc completeThisChallenge];


Answer: [tryobjc completeThisChallenge];
