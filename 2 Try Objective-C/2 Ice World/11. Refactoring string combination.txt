11. Refactoring string combination


Remember how fun it was when we created a string by nesting stringByAppendingString: messages:

NSString *fullname = [[firstName stringByAppendingString:@" "] stringByAppendingString:lastName];

There is actually a much shorter way to do this by sending the stringWithFormat: message to the NSString class:

NSString *fullname = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", firstName, lastName];

You should recognize that format string from working with NSLog. We could log the full name in the same way:

NSLog(@"%@ %@", firstName, lastName);

Just like NSLog, stringWithFormat: expects arguments for each placeholder in the format string. If the number of arguments following the format string doesn’t equal the number of placeholders, then you will get a compiler error like this:

More ‘%’ conversions than data arguments

Update the code to use stringWithFormat: instead of stringByAppendingString:.


File
NSString *firstName = @"Apple";
NSString *lastName = @"Inc";

NSString *fullName = [[firstName stringByAppendingString:@" "] stringByAppendingString:lastName];

NSLog(@"%@", fullName);


Answer:
File
NSString *firstName = @"Apple";
NSString *lastName = @"Inc";

NSString *fullName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", firstName, lastName];

NSLog(@"%@", fullName);


Output:
