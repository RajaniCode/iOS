7. Nesting messages


As you may have seen in the output from the last challenge, there wasn’t a space between your first and last name.

To solve that, we have to append firstName with a single space, like so:

NSString *firstNamePlusSpace = [firstName stringByAppendingString:@" "];

Then we can just append the lastName to that:

NSString *fullname = [firstNamePlusSpace stringByAppendingString:lastName];

It does seem a little silly to create that firstNamePlusSpace variable, since it’s only used temporarily.

We can refactor the above code to do it all in one line, like so:

NSString *firstName = @"Eric";
NSString *lastName = @"Allam";

//NSString *firstNamePlusSpace = [firstName stringByAppendingString:@" "];
NSString *fullName = [[firstName stringByAppendingString:@" "] stringByAppendingString:lastName];


It’s possible to nest message sends within one another, and it’s a common technique in Objective-C to save the programmer a couple of keystrokes. So now we are left with this code:

NSString *fullName = [[firstName stringByAppendingString:@" "] stringByAppendingString:lastName];

Fix the code to log the full name with a space between the firstName and lastName.


File
NSString *firstName = @"Apple";
NSString *lastName = @"Inc";

NSString *fullName = /*//Append firstName and lastName with a space between//*/;

NSLog(@"%@", fullName);


Answer:
File
NSString *firstName = @"Apple";
NSString *lastName = @"Inc";

NSString *fullName = [[firstName stringByAppendingString:@" "] stringByAppendingString:lastName];

NSLog(@"%@", fullName);


Output:
challenge[6]: Apple Inc
